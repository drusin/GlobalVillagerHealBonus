# GlobalVillagerHealBonus

## Requires APIs from papermc, won't work on Spigot! ##

Small plugin that makes discounts after healing zombie villagers apply globally instead of only to the person who has done the healing. 

## Warning ##
This plugin works by directly changing villager data as soon as a player interacts with a unzombified villager. This means that the global discounts that were already seen by players will still be there even if the plugin is removed from the server!
